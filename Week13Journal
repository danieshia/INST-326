This was definitely the toughest week by far, for obvious reasons. We had no issue testing our functions separately, but trying to put everything together was so hard.
We had to use Claude to fix our code to make it look nice, as well as make sure there were no duplicates in our code. We also have to organize our files so they look nicer.
We also used it for test cases just because it takes so much time to do it
