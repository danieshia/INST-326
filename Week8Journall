I had difficulty this week with polymorphism and inheritence vs composition. I think I kept getting confused on what to use where and how to use it.
I did have to use AI for some parts, not necessarily for coding the whole thing but mainly for debugging. 
I did use AI for the tests because I thought that was the easiest way to go about it.
For some reason when I run my tests, sometimes they only work when you only run that specific cell, so I definitely messed up on that part. 
Overall, I had to spend a LOT of time on this this week and I still don't understand it honestly. I'm going to have to practice a lot more.
