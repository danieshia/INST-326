This week, I didn't need to use chat as much as I had previously, but I wasn't able to solve 2 of the problems, and I wasn't able to find a solution with chatGPT either.
I did have to use AI to debug some of my solutions for me because even though I got the general solution, it wasn't always correct. Sometimes I would mess up with making it read-only or private
I also had a hard time with the setters. It was difficult for me to start the dictionaries and the booleans in particular, since I don't work with those often.
