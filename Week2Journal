This week I had to use Ai a lot more than I did last week. I did not know some of the calls/functions that we had to use, such as pop. 
I had a hard time with the last couple of questions since i'm not used to doing problems like that but in the future I will definitely practice a lot more

Hopefully next week it'll be a lot better and I can understand some of the problems more
I think I just need to brush up on my knowledge and go back to my notes from last semester
