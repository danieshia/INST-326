This week I struggled a lot with the exercises. I believe it's because I missed the zoom lecture that I'm a bit confused on some of the concepts.
I did have to use AI for a LOT of the problems (mainly just to explain or help me debug my code) but I think it really made me insecure about my skills
I told myself I wouldn't use AI so much any more but this weeks assignment proved me wrong.
Next week I'm going to work through the assignment day by day so I'm not always turning it in late.
