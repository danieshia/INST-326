I had a hard time with the assignment this week because we've had a significant time skip in terms of material, and I'm having trouble following along with the exercises.
I did have to use chatGPT for a lot of it because I feel like I'm lost but conceptually it makes sense to me. I think I'll have to do a lot more research on what we're doing.
