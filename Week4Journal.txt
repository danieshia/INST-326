In terms of coding, this week was a lot better since a lot of the problems were fairly similar. I did have to use a lot of AI for some of the problems because I just didn't understand how to do it
I also wasn't able to answer 3 of the questions because I just couldn't figure them out in time. I do work so it was hard for me to finish in time (although that's no excuse)
Next week I'll split up the assignment so I can finish it on time and go to TA office hours so I can work it through with you guys.
